\title{Perform UMAP on the Adjacency Matrix of a Milo Object}
\usage{
miloUmap(
  milo,
  slot_name = "UMAP_knngraph",
  n_neighbors = 50L,
  metric = "euclidean",
  min_dist = 0.3,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{milo}{A \code{Milo} object containing a KNN graph. UMAP will be conducted on
the adjacency matrix of this graph.}

\item{slot_name}{Character. The name of the slot in \code{reducedDims} where the UMAP
results will be stored. Default is \code{'UMAP_knngraph'}.}

\item{n_neighbors}{integer, with default 50L.
\itemize{
\item the size of local neighborhood (in terms of number of neighboring sample points) used for manifold approximation.
\item Here, the goal is to create large enough neighborhoods to capture the local manifold structure to allow for hypersampling.
}}

\item{metric}{character, with default 'euclidean'
\itemize{
\item the choice of metric used to measure distance to find nearest neighbors. Default is 'euclidean'.
}}

\item{min_dist}{numeric, with default 0.3
\itemize{
\item the minimum distance between points in the low dimensional space
}}

\item{...}{other parameters passed to uwot::umap}

\value{
milo object with umap reduction
